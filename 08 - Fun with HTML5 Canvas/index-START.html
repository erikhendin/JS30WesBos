<canvas id="draw" width="800" height="800"></canvas>
<script>
  // grab canvas and put it in a variable
  const canvas = document.querySelector('#draw');

  // You need the canvas to draw 
  // however in order to do this in HTML
  // you need to first grab the "context" of the canvas
  //  And we specify 2D (you can also do 3D but that is for another example)
  // create variable and store the context  
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  // size up the canvas to the default width and height of the browser window
  canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
  canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

  // Now we need establish base settings with stroke style, line cap and join
  // when you draw on something it needs to be a color (strokeStyle will reference a css ID)
  // determine what the end of the line should look like
  // should it be squared off when a line meets or "joins" another line, 
  // or should there be rounded corners when they meet
  // there are many options availabble for rounded and squared
  // let's make it rounded
  ctx.strokeStyle = '#BADA55'; // give the stroke a color
  ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
  ctx.lineCap = 'round';
  ctx.lineWidth = 100;

  // blend modes - see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation
  // we can use blend modes like you may see in photoshop
  ctx.globalCompositeOperation='multiply';

  // Now we need a couple of dummy variables
  // isDrawing will serve as a flag to determine when to draw
  // we will need to address x and y coordinates of drawing start and end.

  // In essence drawing with a mouse on screen is:
  // when I click down on this element, 
  // I move my mouse, I let go, 
  // and I move my mouse again,
// nothing should happen when I move my mouse, 
// it should only draw when my cursor/mouse pointer is actually "down".
// So what we will do is create a "flag" with the variable "isDrawing"
// we will set it to false by default
// >when we click down>>, we will set isDrawing to true
// when you click up > when you let go of the button > we will set it to false
// isDrawing is our flag to tell us 
// whether we should draw to this canvas
// or if we are just moving our mouse 
let isDrawing = false;
let lastX = 0;
let lastY = 0; 
// when we draw to a canvas, we draw from one point to another
// so you need a starting x and y and an ending x and y
// you can not just tell it to draw
// a line needs a start and stop - thus the lastx and lasty variables

// Incorporate cool color effect using HSL values
// reference:e https://mothereffinghsl.com/
let hue=0; // variable to manipulate hue (from hue, saturation, lightness)
let direction = true; // we will use this to handle if line is growing or shrinking in width

// draw function:
// we will call this whenever we move our mouse on top of the canvas
function draw(e) {
  if(!isDrawing) return; // this will stop the function from running 
                        // when they are not moused down
                        // we only want to draw on canvas with the mousedown
  console.log(e);

  // set hue saturation and lightness - note the hue variable
  ctx.strokeStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`;
  
  // drawing - start path on the context using beginPath() method
  ctx.beginPath();
  // start with x and y - we defined these lastX and lastY variables earlier in code
  ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY);
  // and move to x and y
  ctx.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY); // e.offsetX is a built-in property of the moouse event
  // we need to call stroke to see anything on the page
  ctx.stroke(); // we need to this to actually draw
  // we need to update the x and y to whereever user's mouse is when it clicked/moused down.
  // update lastX and lastY variables to be wherever there were
  //lastX = e.offsetX;
  //lastY = e.offsetY;
  // you can rewrite above two lines like this:
  [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];  // in ES6 tthis is call the structuring of an array

  // increment hue each time user draws - this will give it a very for cool gradient/rainbow effect
  hue++;
  if (hue >= 360) {
    hue = 0;
  }

  // increment lineWidth from 0 to 100 
  // but once we hit 100 we will go back from 100, 99, 98 etc
  // so if it is greater than 100, or less than 1 flip the direction
  if (ctx.lineWidth >= 100 || ctx.lineWidth <= 1) {
    direction = !direction;
  }

  // depending on what the direction is, we either increment the line width
  // or if the direction is going the other way, we decrement the line width
  if(direction) {
    ctx.lineWidth++;
  } else {
    ctx.lineWidth--;
  }

}
//listen for mouse events on the canvas

// upon mousedown > as soon as the person clicks down the mouse to start it,
// before we do a mouse move,
// we will update the last X and Y 
canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  isDrawing=true;
  // update lastX and lastY so we are starting at current mousedown x y point (rather than starting at 0, 0)
  [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];  // in ES6 tthis is call the structuring of an array
});

// other event listeners listening to the mousemove down or mouseup and mouseout to make sure drawing stops properly as intended
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', () => isDrawing = false);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseout', () => isDrawing = false);
