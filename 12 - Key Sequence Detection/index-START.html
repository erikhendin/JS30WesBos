// key sequencing detection!
//whenever someone presses a key we are going to push it into an array
const pressed = []; // holder for key presses
const secretCode='erik';

  // listen for key up event 
  window.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {
    console.log(e.key); // tell us key that we pressed
    pressed.push(e.key); // whenever someone presses an item, push key into array


    // trim the array to be the maximum number of characters that wwe need
    // So make the length of the pressed array the length of the "secret code"
    // so say secretCode is six letters we would look for six characters
    // We want to count from the back (from the end, so length of array-1)
    // for example if we typed wesbosiscool 
    //- if we started splicing/trimming from the beginning we would be cutting out the characters we need
    // to go from the end we use -secretCode.length - 1
    /// so if it's six letters, then that will go from the back in to position 5(the sixth character because position 0 is the first character) 
// Trim from end using then pressed.length - secretCode.length
// so it should always just have six letters
// or more to the point - it should always be the same number of characters as the "secret code" 

    //check if array contains secret code we are looking for
    // pressed.join() will concatenate letters in array to form a string.
    // so if the string includes the secret code...
    if(pressed.join('').includes(secretCode)) {
      // woo hoo!
      console.log('DING DING!');
      // show some unicorns
      cornify_add();
    }
    console.log(pressed);
