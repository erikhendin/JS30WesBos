// Reference vs. Copy:
// Object references, Array references vs copying them

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age=200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name='Wes';

    console.log(name, name2); // Wesley, Wes
*/

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3]='Lux'; 

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // it changes BOTH arrays!
    console.log(team,players); // BOTH arrays now have Lux 
    // This is because here team is just a REFERENCE to Players array 
    // so team[3]='Lux'; is not the same thing as what we did with strings, numbers or booleans
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way: use slice(); to return a copy of the array
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // this will take all of the items from the players array
                                      // and concatenate them into the team3 array console.log(team2);

    // 

    // ****
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]   // this takes every item out of your iterable 
                                // and put it into the containing array
                                // so this will take a copy of it as well

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'heee hawww';
    console.log(team4, players);

    // you can also use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3]='cool';
    console.log(team5, players); // team5 is updated, but players array is stil untouched


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
//    const captain = person;  // you cannot ddo this because if you change the captain's age to 99
//    captain.age = 99             // it will chagne person's age to 99
//    console.log(person, captain);

    // why did this happen? Because we made a REFERENCE to the original object
    // we want to take a COPY of the original object, set new values in copy, and not change the original object

    // how do we take a copy instead? use Object.assign()
              // How Object.assign() works: {} start with/take blank object, copy all properties from source object, then fold in your new properties that you want to write)                                   
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    cap2.name = 'Erik Hendin';
    
    console.log(cap2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; // you can spread into an object the same way we did above with an array

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    // if I want to make a copy of wes
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name='Wesley';  // this will work for copy and changing name because name is 1 level deep
    //HOWEVER this will change BOTH OBJECTS
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(dev.social, wes.social);

    // this becausee when you use Object.assign() it only works for 1 level deep.
    
    // if you need to go do a CLONE there is a function out there called "clone deep"
    // and that will clone every level, as deep as you want.
    // but you should ask yourself if you really need this before you use it.
    // very rarely do you need clone an object at every level deep

    // ANOTHER WAY - andthis is a bit of a "poor man's" way to clone everylevel
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = 'coolmanErik';
    console.log(dev2);
    // this works because you can take JSON.stringify and pass it an object
    // this will return to you a STRING - it is no longer an object
    // then  you JSON.parse it to turn it back into an object
    // and then you get a fully copy of it without any association to the previous references
    // Note - not sure if this is a good idea for performance
    // This is referred to as "poor man's deep clone"
