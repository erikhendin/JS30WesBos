<!--
Tapas menu - you can add things and check them.
If you refresh the page - your selections will still be there
We are persisting the state of the list/and checkboxes/checkbox selections- with local storage
Event delegation can address the following problem:
When you add an event listener to an item that did not exist when the page was loaded, then in the future it won't be cclicked.
However, with Event delegation: When I add another item to the list, i.e. "fish", 
you can select it annd have it remain selected, and again when you refesh the page 
the checkbox will still be there, and the selected state (checked/unchecked etc) will also still be there

Every time we make a change,
We are going to mirror that to localStorage

challenge:
-Make a button 
-that says clear all - clears all selections
-that says delete - will delete all of them 
-button that says check all - that will check all checkboxes
All buttons trigger actions thatt will be mirrored to localStorage, and re-run populateList(items, itemsList)

/*Local Storage - you can store your data in localStorage
There is an object in the browser called localStorage
It is a list of things that have been saved to the domain - only locally
You are able to save text to the browser
and even when you reload the page you are still able to save text out of it
(If you go to Chrome DevTools > Application tab > Local Storage > click on the domain you are working)
You will see Key and Value 
This is where we are storing "done=false etc"
